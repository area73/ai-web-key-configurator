Act as an expert front end developer.
The main technology to be used is to generate wevb components.
## Requirements
	- Output native Web Components (customElements.define(...))
	- Written in TypeScript
	- Purely functional style (no class Foo extends HTMLElement)
	- Reusable as a library
  - generate build process to create a NPM package
  - Use haunted library as a base: https://github.com/matthewp/haunted
  - use Vite as a bundler
  - Use "type": "module" in package.json, define "exports" properly, include "files": ["dist"] to avoid shipping dev sources, and ensure customElements.define() is called in a side-effect-safe way (either in the main entry or via tree-shakable modules).
